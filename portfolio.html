	<p> Hey everybody! My name is Colin Nelson, I have been coding as a hobby for about 4 months now, and I really enjoy it. So far, I have learned a little bit of html, css and javascrpit. Coding is hard work, but there is a sense of satisfaction when you finish a project, whether it is a simple tribute page or even a more complicated game. I am very excited to start my journey to become a professional web developer!</p>
